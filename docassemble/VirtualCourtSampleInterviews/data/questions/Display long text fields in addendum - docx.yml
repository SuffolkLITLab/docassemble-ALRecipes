  If you have text fields that could be too long to display on your template file, this interview illustrates how to display them in your addendum by calling the 'addenda' module.
  
  It is assumed that your main template is a docx file, thus the condition for addendum is used in the docx.
 
  Copy the docx addendum file used in this interview. You can change the docx name and its heading.

  #1. Put text fields into a list  
  tmpList = myTextList(other_relief, 40, 'PART J(5). Losses suffered by the Plaintiff')
  txtList1 = tmpList.txtList
  other_relief_cutoff = tmpList.text_cutoff #to be used in the main form
  
  tmpList = myTextList(losses, 35, 'PART J(8). Other order requested')
  txtList2 = tmpList.txtList
  losses_cutoff = tmpList.text_cutoff #to be used in the main form
  
  #2 Merge the above lists into txtFieldsList (standard name used in addendum)
  txtFieldsList = txtList1 + txtList2
  
  #3. Check if we should invoke addendum
  addAddendum = bool(txtFieldsList)
