question: |
  Compare regular date type with textdate type.
subquestion: | 
  This sample shows you how to use a **textDateInput** type.<br/><br/>
  textDateInput is good for dates such as birth_date where it's easier for a user to type than using a long dropdown, or when a browser doesn't honor a datepicker.
  
  Please note that **date validation message and cursor focus are controlled by the server side, thus out of our control**.

  - Date of birth: date_of_birth
