  This sample interview illustrates how to handle two-party signature question flow and output, if your template is in **pdf**. (For **docx** template, see sample interview **Multiuser Signatures - docx**.)
  
  In this interview, the main form template is a pdf file. If the original signatures are on a separate page, you can move it into a docx file and follow this sample interview's code. If the signature page is not separatable, you will need some additional code, see sample interview **Preview pdf without remapping** to learn how to skip a signature in the preview stage.
