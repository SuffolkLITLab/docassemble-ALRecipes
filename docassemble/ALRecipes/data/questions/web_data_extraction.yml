  Web data extraction example
subquestion: |
  Sometimes it's useful to extract a piece of data from an external website, and display the result in your docassembly interview. 
  
  This example goes to https://janedoe.org to extract Massachusetts DV Hotline information, then displays the results on the screen as well as in a template docx file. The python tools used are **mechanize** and **HTMLParser**.  
  
  When you develop your own data extracting code, you need to inspect your target site in order to find the ID/class names of the relavent input and output items, then use them in your code accordingly. 
  
  As a courtesy, remember to give credit to the website from which you extract the data.
