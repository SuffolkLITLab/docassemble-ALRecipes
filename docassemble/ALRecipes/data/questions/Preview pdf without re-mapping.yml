  Preview pdf without re-mapping the fields
subquestion: |  
  This recipe illustrates how to build the preview of a pdf template with signature, but without having to repeat the field mapping for the final version of output. 
  
  **The user doesn't need to log in.**
  
  In other words, you only need one attachment block. This is achieved by using "reconsider" in order to trigger it again in the final stage, and of course by mapping the signature field to a calculated variable.

  For preview screen, map the signature field to blank.
mandatory: true
code: |
  calSignature = ''  
  previewFile = pdf_concatenate(main,filename="impoundmen_preview.pdf")

  For final screen, map the signature field to the signature question. Then construct the typical dowload section of the final screen.
code: |      
  calSignature = signature
  finalFile.pdf = pdf_concatenate(main)
  finalFile.info = {
    'name': 'impoundment', 
    'filename': 'impoundment', 
    'description': 'Alternative way to build pdf preview.', 
    'file': {'pdf': finalFile.pdf.number}, 
    'mimetype': {'pdf': finalFile.pdf.mimetype}
  }
  finalFile.finished = True
