  Add an addendum file to a pdf main form
subquestion: | 
  This recipe interview illustrates how to add a docx addendum file to a pdf main template. In this interview, fields in the pdf form are only partially coded for illustration purposes.
  
  How to add an addendum file: 
  
  * Create a docx file and load it to the template folder. 
  * Add an "attachment" block for this docx file. 
  * Use code to combine your original pdf template with the new docx file.
  * Display this combined file on the final screen.
  
  If your main form is a docx file, see "Addenda - extra table records.yml" in the "AssemblyLineToolbox" package.
